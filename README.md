# Student-Grade-Prdiction
Here for this project we have applied Multivariate techniques on Student Alcohol Consumption data from Kaggle to to analyze demographic information, habits and alcohol consumption patterns to understand their impact on Student Grades. Various multivariate techniques like regression, classidication and clustering have been used. The goal here was to identify which are the significant variables which can help in predicting student grades. The datset was obtained from kaggle. 

Apart from the R code I have also included some other documents like word, pdf and ppt files which better understand the problem that we were trying to solve.
